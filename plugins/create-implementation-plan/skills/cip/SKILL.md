# Create Implementation Plan

Resolve/scaffold the plan with existing deterministic scripts. Discover prior work only from a filtered
index or explicit canonical IDs, then load at most three selected current Markdown artifacts through
`.github/skills/cip/scripts/Get-DirectPlanArtifactConsumerContext.ps1`. Keep confinement, secret
screening, accepted-only provenance, untrusted framing, and current intent/contracts above history.

Before drafting, follow
[`./assets/decision-protocol.md`](./assets/decision-protocol.md). It defines host-equivalent complex
choices and the absolute/fuzzy language confirmation gate. Do not draft an unconfirmed absolute or an
unobservable fuzzy requirement.

Confirm current intent first and draft directly with zero delegated calls. If a concrete unresolved
choice spans design and acceptance criteria, use one combined Terra/high design-and-requirements call;
Claude Sonnet 5 is its replacement fallback. Use Sol/high only for cross-subsystem work still unresolved
after evidence-backed Terra work, and one Opus/high pass only for a named high-risk independent concern.
No automatic Judge or unchanged-scope rerun exists: deterministic evidence is the normal judge. Every
call, retry, and replacement counts toward a three-call ceiling; a fourth requires a new operator
decision. Delegated prompts target 400 words and must be narrowed before 800. Use a direct risk-selected
DR only for concrete unresolved design risk; no scheduler or fixed
matrix. For observable background calls, two no-progress checks permit one same-agent redirect and at
most one replacement. Elapsed agent time never cancels work; declared deterministic command timeouts
remain.

Before final drafting, confirm the current intent, requirements, risks, and decisions together. Persist
the existing planning-confirmed marker only after that confirmation. Typed evidence remains exactly
`test:`, `file:`, and `review:`. Draft MVP-first vertical steps and retain script-owned validation/stage
mutations. Any later criteria correction returns to the affected confirmation rather than weakening it.
